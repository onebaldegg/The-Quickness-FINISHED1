## 📋 **Updated Chrome Web Store Submission:**

### **New ZIP File**: `THE_QUICKNESS_v1.1.1_ActiveTab.zip` (141KB)

### **Permissions Justifications (Updated):**

**activeTab justification:**
```
Required for core functionality to capture screenshots and inject note-taking interface when user clicks extension icon. Uses chrome.tabs.captureVisibleTab() API and chrome.scripting for dynamic script injection. Extension only accesses tabs when explicitly activated by user click, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
```

**scripting justification:**
```
Essential for dynamically injecting the note-taking modal interface into webpages when user activates extension. Uses chrome.scripting.executeScript() to inject content scripts that display the purple modal, handle user input, and manage screenshot-to-PDF workflow. Only activates when user clicks extension icon.
```

**(Other permissions remain the same)**

### **Host Permissions Question:**
**Answer**: ❌ **NONE** (Leave blank - no host permissions needed!)
