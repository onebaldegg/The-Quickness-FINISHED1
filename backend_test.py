Backend Test for THE QUICKNESS Chrome Extension

This test file is created to document that THE QUICKNESS Chrome extension
does not have any backend API components to test.

The extension operates entirely within the browser and doesn't have any
backend API dependencies. All functionality is implemented in JavaScript
within the browser extension context.

Key components of the extension:
1. Icon Click Screenshot - Implemented in content.js and background.js
2. Note Modal with Logo - Implemented in content.js
3. Landscape PDF Generation - Implemented in content.js
4. Link Preservation - Implemented in content.js
5. Background Script Icon Click Handler - Implemented in background.js
6. Manifest Updates - Implemented in manifest.json

These are all frontend/browser extension components and cannot be tested
through backend API testing.
