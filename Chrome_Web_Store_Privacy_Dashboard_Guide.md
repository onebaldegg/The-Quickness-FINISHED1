## Data Handling Summary for Dashboard

**Copy this text for Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard:**

> THE QUICKNESS processes user data exclusively within the browser for core functionality. Screenshots, user notes, and webpage URLs are processed locally to generate PDF documents and create bookmarks. No data is collected, transmitted, or shared with external parties. All processing occurs locally within the user's browser environment. Generated PDFs are saved to the user's local Downloads folder. The extension uses Chrome's built-in APIs (tabs, downloads, bookmarks, storage) solely for providing the requested screenshot-to-PDF functionality. No analytics, tracking, or data collection services are used. Complete data handling details are provided in our comprehensive privacy policy.

## Prominent Disclosure Implementation

**Since THE QUICKNESS processes data locally and doesn't collect personal data for purposes beyond core functionality, prominent disclosure requirements are satisfied by:**

1. **Extension Description**: Clear description of screenshot and PDF functionality
2. **Privacy Policy**: Comprehensive policy accessible to all users  
3. **User-Initiated Actions**: Extension only activates when user explicitly clicks icon
4. **Transparent Processing**: All data processing is immediately visible to user (PDFs saved locally)
